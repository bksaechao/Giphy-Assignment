# Giphy-Assignment
This Giphy Assignment challenges the student's understanding of API's and how to reference their data. Student's were tasked with creating an application that allowed users to generate 10 gif's of a topic that was clicked on. When each gif was clicked on, the gif would play it's animation and would stop when clicked on again. Users would also be able to enter in and generate gifs of their own topic of choice.<br><br>
